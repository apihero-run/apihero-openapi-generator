This is where commit data is fetched from the original repository. The import progress response will include `commit_count` (the total number of raw commits that will be imported) and `percent` (0 - 100, the current progress through the import).\n*   `mapping` - the \"rewrite\" step of the import is in progress. This is where SVN branches are converted to Git branches, and where author updates are applied. The import progress response does not include progress information.\n*   `pushing` - the \"push\" step of the import is in progress. This is where the importer updates the repository on GitHub. The import progress response will include `push_percent`, which is the percent value reported by `git push` when it is \"Writing objects\".\n*   `complete` - the import is complete, and the repository is ready on GitHub.\n\nIf there are problems, you will see one of these in the `status` field:\n\n*   `auth_failed` - the import requires authentication in order to connect to the original repository.

The import progress response will include the `failed_step` and an error message. Contact [GitHub Support](https://support.github.com/contact?tags=dotcom-rest-api) for more information.\n*   `detection_needs_auth` - the importer requires authentication for the originating repository to continue detection. To update authentication for the import, please see the [Update an import](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/migrations#update-an-import) section.\n*   `detection_found_nothing` - the importer didn't recognize any source control at the URL.

At GitHub we often deploy branches and verify them\nbefore we merge a pull request.\n\nThe `environment` parameter allows deployments to be issued to different runtime environments. Teams often have\nmultiple environments for verifying their applications, such as `production`, `staging`, and `qa`. This parameter\nmakes it easier to track which environments have requested deployments. The default environment is `production`.\n\nThe `auto_merge` parameter is used to ensure that the requested ref is not behind the repository's default branch. If\nthe ref _is_ behind the default branch for the repository, we will attempt to merge it for you. If the merge succeeds,\nthe API will return a successful merge commit. If merge conflicts prevent the merge from succeeding, the API will\nreturn a failure response.\n\nBy default, [commit statuses](https://docs.github.com/rest/commits/statuses) for every submitted context must be in a `success`\nstate. The `required_contexts` parameter allows you to specify a subset of contexts that must be `success`, or to\nspecify contexts that have not yet been submitted. You are not required to use commit statuses to deploy. If you do\nnot require any contexts or create any commit statuses, the deployment will always succeed.\n\nThe `payload` parameter is available for any extra information that a deployment system might need. It is a JSON text\nfield that will be passed on when a deployment event is dispatched.\n\nThe `task` parameter is used by the deployment system to allow different execution paths. In the web world this might\nbe `deploy:migrations` to run schema changes on the system. In the compiled world this could be a flag to compile an\napplication with debugging enabled.\n\nUsers with `repo` or `repo_deployment` scopes can create a deployment for a given ref.\n\n#### Merged branch response\nYou will see this response when GitHub automatically merges the base branch into the topic branch instead of creating\na deployment. This auto-merge happens when:\n*   Auto-merge option is enabled in the repository\n*   Topic branch does not include the latest changes on the base branch, which is `master` in the response example\n*   There are no merge conflicts\n\nIf there are no new commits in the base branch, a new request to create a deployment should give a successful\nresponse.\n\n#### Merge conflict response\nThis error happens when the `auto_merge` option is enabled and when the default branch (in this case `master`), can't\nbe merged into the branch that's being deployed (in this case `topic-branch`), due to merge conflicts.\n\n#### Failed commit status checks\nThis error happens when the `required_contexts` parameter indicates that one or more contexts need to have a `success`\nstatus for the commit to be deployed, but one or more of the required contexts do not have a state of `success`.","deprecated":false,"externalDocs":{"url":"https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/repos#create-a-deployment","description":"API method documentation"},"tags":["repos"],"security":[{"installationToken":[]}],"parameters":[{"$ref":"#/components/parameters/owner","description":"The account owner of the repository.

Specify the file path or directory in `:path`. If you omit\n`:path`, you will receive the contents of the repository's root directory. See the description below regarding what the API response includes for directories. \n\nFiles and symlinks support [a custom media type](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/repos#custom-media-types) for\nretrieving the raw content or rendered HTML (when supported). All content types support [a custom media\ntype](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/repos#custom-media-types) to ensure the content is returned in a consistent\nobject format.\n\n**Note**:\n*   To get a repository's contents recursively, you can [recursively get the tree](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/git#trees).\n*   This API has an upper limit of 1,000 files for a directory. If you need to retrieve more files, use the [Git Trees\nAPI](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/git#get-a-tree).\n\n#### Size limits\nIf the requested file's size is:\n* 1 MB or smaller: All features of this endpoint are supported.\n* Between 1-100 MB: Only the `raw` or `object` [custom media types](https://docs.github.com/rest/repos/contents#custom-media-types-for-repository-contents) are supported. Both will work as normal, except that when using the `object` media type, the `content` field will be an empty string and the `encoding` field will be `\"none\"`. To get the contents of these larger files, use the `raw` media type.\n * Greater than 100 MB: This endpoint is not supported.\n\n#### If the content is a directory\nThe response will be an array of objects, one object for each item in the directory.\nWhen listing the contents of a directory, submodules have their \"type\" specified as \"file\". Logically, the value\n_should_ be \"submodule\". This behavior exists in API v3 [for backwards compatibility purposes](https://git.io/v1YCW).\nIn the next major version of the API, the type will be returned as \"submodule\".\n\n#### If the content is a symlink \nIf the requested `:path` points to a symlink, and the symlink's target is a normal file in the repository, then the\nAPI responds with the content of the file (in the format shown in the example. Otherwise, the API responds with an object \ndescribing the symlink itself.\n\n#### If the content is a submodule\nThe `submodule_git_url` identifies the location of the submodule repository, and the `sha` identifies a specific\ncommit within the submodule repository. Git uses the given URL when cloning the submodule repository, and checks out\nthe submodule at that specific commit.\n\nIf the submodule repository is not hosted on github.com, the Git URLs (`git_url` and `_links[\"git\"]`) and the\ngithub.com URLs (`html_url` and `_links[\"html\"]`) will have null values.","deprecated":false,"externalDocs":{"url":"https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/repos#get-repository-content","description":"API method documentation"},"tags":["repos"],"security":[{"installationToken":[]}],"parameters":[{"$ref":"#/components/parameters/owner","description":"The account owner of the repository.

For more information on working with pagination, see \"[Traversing with pagination](/rest/guides/traversing-with-pagination).\"\n\nWhen calling this API without any paging parameters (`per_page` or `page`), the returned list is limited to 250 commits and the last commit in the list is the most recent of the entire comparison.

For public repositories,\nyou must use an access token with `public_repo` scope.\nGitHub Apps must have the `security_events` write permission to use this endpoint.\n\nYou can delete one analysis at a time.\nTo delete a series of analyses, start with the most recent analysis and work backwards.\nConceptually, the process is similar to the undo function in a text editor.\n\nWhen you list the analyses for a repository,\none or more will be identified as deletable in the response:\n\n```\n\"deletable\": true\n```\n\nAn analysis is deletable when it's the most recent in a set of analyses.\nTypically, a repository will have multiple sets of analyses\nfor each enabled code scanning tool,\nwhere a set is determined by a unique combination of analysis values:\n\n* `ref`\n* `tool`\n* `analysis_key`\n* `environment`\n\nIf you attempt to delete an analysis that is not the most recent in a set,\nyou'll get a 400 response with the message:\n\n```\nAnalysis specified is not deletable.\n```\n\nThe response from a successful `DELETE` operation provides you with\ntwo alternative URLs for deleting the next analysis in the set:\n`next_analysis_url` and `confirm_delete_url`.\nUse the `next_analysis_url` URL if you want to avoid accidentally deleting the final analysis\nin a set. This is a useful option if you want to preserve at least one analysis\nfor the specified tool in your repository.\nUse the `confirm_delete_url` URL if you are content to remove all analyses for a tool.\nWhen you delete the last analysis in a set, the value of `next_analysis_url` and `confirm_delete_url`\nin the 200 response is `null`.\n\nAs an example of the deletion process,\nlet's imagine that you added a workflow that configured a particular code scanning tool\nto analyze the code in a repository. This tool has added 15 analyses:\n10 on the default branch, and another 5 on a topic branch.\nYou therefore have two separate sets of analyses for this tool.\nYou've now decided that you want to remove all of the analyses for the tool.\nTo do this you must make 15 separate deletion requests.\nTo start, you must find an analysis that's identified as deletable.\nEach set of analyses always has one that's identified as deletable.\nHaving found the deletable analysis for one of the two sets,\ndelete this analysis and then continue deleting the next analysis in the set until they're all deleted.\nThen repeat the process for the second set.\nThe procedure therefore consists of a nested loop:\n\n**Outer loop**:\n* List the analyses for the repository, filtered by tool.\n* Parse this list to find a deletable analysis. If found:\n\n  **Inner loop**:\n  * Delete the identified analysis.\n  * Parse the response for the value of `confirm_delete_url` and, if found, use this in the next iteration.\n\nThe above process assumes that you want to remove all trace of the tool's analyses from the GitHub user interface, for the specified repository, and it therefore uses the `confirm_delete_url` value. Alternatively, you could use the `next_analysis_url` value, which would leave the last analysis in each set undeleted to avoid removing a tool's analysis entirely.","deprecated":false,"externalDocs":{"url":"https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/code-scanning#delete-a-code-scanning-analysis-from-a-repository","description":"API method documentation"},"tags":["code-scanning"],"security":[{"installationToken":[]}],"parameters":[{"$ref":"#/components/parameters/owner","description":"The account owner of the repository.

Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct\n\n## Our Pledge\n\nIn the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.\n\n## Our Standards\n\nExamples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:\n\n* Using welcoming and inclusive language\n* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences\n* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism\n* Focusing on what is best for the community\n* Showing empathy towards other community members\n\nExamples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:\n\n* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances\n* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks\n* Public or private harassment\n* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission\n* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting\n\n## Our Responsibilities\n\nProject maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response\n                  to any instances of unacceptable behavior.\n\nProject maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.\n\n## Scope\n\nThis Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address,\n                  posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.\n\n## Enforcement\n\nInstances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [EMAIL].

Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct\n\n## Our Pledge\n\nIn the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.\n\n## Our Standards\n\nExamples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:\n\n* Using welcoming and inclusive language\n* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences\n* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism\n* Focusing on what is best for the community\n* Showing empathy towards other community members\n\nExamples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:\n\n* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances\n* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks\n* Public or private harassment\n* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission\n* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting\n\n## Our Responsibilities\n\nProject maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response\n                  to any instances of unacceptable behavior.\n\nProject maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.\n\n## Scope\n\nThis Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address,\n                  posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.\n\n## Enforcement\n\nInstances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [EMAIL]. The project team will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.\n\nProject maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.\n\n## Attribution\n\nThis Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant][homepage], version 1.4, available at

Before authenticating as an installation, you must create an installation access token. Ensure that you have already installed your GitHub App to at least one repository; it is impossible to create an installation token without a single installation. These installation access tokens are used by GitHub Apps to authenticate. For more information, see \"[Installing GitHub Apps](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/managing-github-apps/installing-github-apps).\"\n\nBy default, installation access tokens are scoped to all the repositories that an installation can access. You can limit the scope of the installation access token to specific repositories by using the `repository_ids` parameter. See the [Create an installation access token for an app](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/apps#create-an-installation-access-token-for-an-app) endpoint for more details. Installation access tokens have the permissions configured by the GitHub App and expire after one hour.\n\nTo list the installations for an authenticated app, include the JWT [generated above](#jwt-payload) in the Authorization header in the API request:\n\n```shell\n$ curl -i -X GET \\\n-H \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT\" \\\n-H \"Accept: application/vnd.github+json\" \\\nhttps://api.github.com/app/installations\n```\n\nThe response will include a list of installations where each installation's `id` can be used for creating an installation access token. For more information about the response format, see \"[List installations for the authenticated app](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/apps#list-installations-for-the-authenticated-app).\"\n\nTo create an installation access token, include the JWT [generated above](#jwt-payload) in the Authorization header in the API request and replace `:installation_id` with the installation's `id`:\n\n```shell\n$ curl -i -X POST \\\n-H \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT\" \\\n-H \"Accept: application/vnd.github+json\" \\\nhttps://api.github.com/app/installations/:installation_id/access_tokens\n```\n\nThe response will include your installation access token, the expiration date, the token's permissions, and the repositories that the token can access. For more information about the response format, see the [Create an installation access token for an app](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/apps#create-an-installation-access-token-for-an-app) endpoint.\n\nTo authenticate with an installation access token, include it in the Authorization header in the API request:\n\n```shell\n$ curl -i \\\n-H \"Authorization: token YOUR_INSTALLATION_ACCESS_TOKEN\" \\\n-H \"Accept: application/vnd.github+json\" \\\nhttps://api.github.com/installation/repositories\n```\n\n`YOUR_INSTALLATION_ACCESS_TOKEN` is the value you must replace.","type":"http","scheme":"bearer","x-apihero":{"scopes":{"merge_queues:write":"Manage a repository's merge queues (read and write)","actions:read":"Workflows, workflow runs and artifacts.
